# MDX Components

You can provide custom React components for your MDX files. Just follow the steps below:

- Create a `components.js` file in the `src/gatsby-theme-dox` directory.
- Export an object with your custom React components.

```js
// src/gatsby-theme-dox/navbar.yaml
import components from 'gatsby-theme-dox/src/components'

export default {
  ...components // default components
}
```

- You should include the default components from the theme.

Then you can use those components in your MDX files.
